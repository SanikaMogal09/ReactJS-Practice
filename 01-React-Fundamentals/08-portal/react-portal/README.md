<!-- PORTAL -->

Portal is a feature that allows you to render a child component into a DOM node that exits outside the hierarchy of the parent component.

This can be useful for scenarios like modals, tooltips, or dropdowns, where you want to break out of the usual parent-child structure and render in a different part of the DOM.
